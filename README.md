# Etch-A-Sketch

## Overview
Etch-A-Sketch is a simple browser-based drawing app that allows users to sketch by hovering over a grid of squares. The grid dynamically updates based on user input, mimicking the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy.

## Features
- A 16x16 grid of squares (default) that changes color on hover.
- A button to reset and generate a new grid of user-defined size.
- Uses Flexbox to create a responsive and uniform grid layout.
- Random color generation and progressive darkening effect for an enhanced drawing experience.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout using Flexbox.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic grid generation and event handling.

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage in a browser.
2. Move the mouse over the grid to start drawing.
